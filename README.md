# Text Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores a basic natural language processing task where text data
is classified into sentiment categories using classical machine learning methods.

## Dataset
The project uses a movie reviews dataset where each review is labeled as
positive or negative.

## Approach
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics

## Learnings
- How raw text is converted into numerical features
- Importance of preprocessing in NLP pipelines
- Strengths and limitations of classical ML models for NLP

## Limitations
- Works only for English text
- Uses classical ML models, not deep learning

## Future Work
- Extend to multilingual text
- Compare results with transformer-based models
