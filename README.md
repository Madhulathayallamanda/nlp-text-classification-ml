# Text Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores a basic natural language processing task where text data
is classified into predefined categories using classical machine learning methods.

## Approach
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training using classical ML algorithms
- Performance evaluation using standard metrics

## Learnings
- How raw text is converted into numerical features
- Strengths and limitations of classical ML for NLP tasks
- Importance of preprocessing in NLP pipelines

## Limitations
- Works only for English text
- Uses classical ML, not deep learning

## Future Work
- Extend to multilingual text
- Compare with transformer-based models
